\title{A cluster future is a future whose value will be resolved asynchronously in a parallel process}
\usage{
ClusterFuture(expr = NULL, envir = parent.frame(), substitute = FALSE,
  globals = TRUE, packages = NULL, local = !persistent, gc = FALSE,
  persistent = FALSE, workers = NULL, user = NULL, master = NULL,
  revtunnel = TRUE, homogeneous = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{An R \link[base]{expression}.}

\item{envir}{The \link{environment} in which the evaluation
is done (or inherits from if \code{local} is TRUE).}

\item{substitute}{If TRUE, argument \code{expr} is
\code{\link[base]{substitute}()}:ed, otherwise not.}

\item{globals}{(optional) a logical, a character vector,
or a named list for controlling how globals are handled.
For details, see section 'Globals used by future expressions'
in the help for \code{\link{future}()}.}

\item{persistent}{If FALSE, the evaluation environment is cleared
from objects prior to the evaluation of the future.}

\item{workers}{A \code{\link[parallel:makeCluster]{cluster}}.
Alternatively, a character vector of host names or a numeric scalar,
for creating a cluster via \code{\link[parallel]{makeCluster}(workers)}.}

\item{user}{(optional) The user name to be used when communicating
with another host.}

\item{master}{(optional) The hostname or IP address of the master
machine running this node.}

\item{revtunnel}{If TRUE, reverse SSH tunneling is used for the
PSOCK cluster nodes to connect back to the master R process.  This
avoids the hassle of firewalls, port forwarding and having to know
the internal / public IP address of the master R session.}

\item{homogeneous}{If TRUE, all cluster nodes is assumed to use the
same path to \file{Rscript} as the main R session.  If FALSE, the
it is assumed to be on the PATH for each node.}

\item{...}{Additional named elements passed to \code{\link{Future}()}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{ClusterFuture}.
}
