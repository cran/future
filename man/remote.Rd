\title{Create a remote future whose value will be resolved asynchronously in a remote process}
\usage{
remote(expr, envir = parent.frame(), substitute = TRUE, lazy = FALSE,
  seed = NULL, globals = TRUE, persistent = TRUE, workers = NULL,
  user = NULL, revtunnel = TRUE, gc = FALSE, earlySignal = FALSE,
  myip = NULL, label = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{An \R \link[base]{expression}.}

\item{envir}{The \link{environment} from where global objects should be
identified.}

\item{substitute}{If TRUE, argument \code{expr} is
\code{\link[base]{substitute}()}:ed, otherwise not.}

\item{lazy}{If \code{FALSE} (default), the future is resolved
eagerly (starting immediately), otherwise not.}

\item{seed}{(optional) A L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG seed.}

\item{globals}{(optional) a logical, a character vector, or a named list
to control how globals are handled.
For details, see section 'Globals used by future expressions'
in the help for \code{\link{future}()}.}

\item{persistent}{If FALSE, the evaluation environment is cleared
from objects prior to the evaluation of the future.}

\item{workers}{A positive numeric scalar or a function specifying the
maximum number of parallel futures that can be active at the same time
before blocking.
If a function, it is called without arguments \emph{when the future
is created} and its value is used to configure the workers.
The function should return a numeric scalar.}

\item{user}{(optional) The user name to be used when communicating
with another host.}

\item{revtunnel}{If TRUE, reverse SSH tunneling is used for the
PSOCK cluster nodes to connect back to the master \R process.  This
avoids the hassle of firewalls, port forwarding and having to know
the internal / public IP address of the master \R session.}

\item{gc}{If TRUE, the garbage collector run (in the process that
evaluated the future) after the value of the future is collected.
\emph{Some types of futures ignore this argument.}}

\item{earlySignal}{Specified whether conditions should be signaled as soon
as possible or not.}

\item{myip}{The external IP address of this machine.
If NULL, then it is inferred using an online service (default).}

\item{label}{An optional character string label attached to the future.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the "evaluator".}
}
\value{
A \link{ClusterFuture}.
}
\description{
A remote future is a future that uses remote cluster evaluation,
which means that its \emph{value is computed and resolved
remotely in another process}.
}
\details{
Note that remote futures use \code{persistent = TRUE} by default.

## Use a remote machine

## Evaluate expression remotely
