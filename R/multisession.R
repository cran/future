#' Create a multisession future whose value will be resolved asynchronously in a parallel R session
#'
#' A multisession future is a future that uses multisession evaluation,
#' which means that its \emph{value is computed and resolved in
#' parallel in another R session}.
#'
#' @inheritParams future
#' @inheritParams multiprocess
#' @inheritParams cluster
#' @param workers The maximum number of multisession futures that
#' can be active at the same time before blocking.
#'
#' @return A \link{MultisessionFuture}.
#' If \code{workers == 1}, then all processing using done in the
#' current/main R session and we therefore fall back to using
#' a lazy future.
#'
## FIXME: It seem that multisession futures in examples gives errors
##        with R CMD check, e.g. "cannot open file 'future-Ex.Rout':
##        Permission denied".  Because of this we use \donttest{}.
#'@example incl/multisession.R
#'
#' @details
#' This function will block if all available R session are occupied
#' and will be unblocked as soon as one of the already running
#' multisession futures is resolved.  For the total number of
#' R sessions available including the current/main R process, see
#' \code{\link{availableCores}()}.
#'
#' A multisession future is a special type of cluster future.
#'
#' The preferred way to create an multisession future is not to call
#' this function directly, but to register it via
#' \code{\link{plan}(multisession)} such that it becomes the default
#' mechanism for all futures.  After this \code{\link{future}()}
#' and \code{\link{\%<-\%}} will create \emph{multisession futures}.
#'
#' @section Known issues:
#' In the current implementation, \emph{all} background R sessions
#' are allocated and launched in the background \emph{as soon as the
#' first multisession future is created}. This means that more R
#' sessions may be running than what will ever be used.
#' The reason for this is that background sessions are currently
#' created using \code{\link[parallel:makeCluster]{makeCluster}()},
#' which requires that all R sessions are created at once.
#'
#' @seealso
#' For processing in multiple forked R sessions, see
#' \link{multicore} futures.
#' For multicore processing with fallback to multisession where
#' the former is not supported, see \link{multiprocess} futures.
#'
#' Use \code{\link{availableCores}()} to see the total number of
#' cores that are available for the current R session.
