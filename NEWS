Package: future
===============

Version: 0.6.0 [2015-06-18]
o Add multicore futures, which are futures that are resolved
  asynchronously in a separate process.  These are only
  supported on Unix-like systems, but not on Windows.


Version: 0.5.1 [2015-06-18]
o Eager and lazy futures now records the result internally
  such that the expression is only evaluated once, even if
  their errored values are requested multiple times.
o Eager futures are always created regardless of error or not.
o All Future objects are environments themselves that record
  the expression, the call environment and optional variables.


Version: 0.5.0 [2015-06-16]
o lazy() "freezes" global variables at the time when
  the future is created.  This way the result of a lazy
  future is more likely to be the same as an eager future.
  This is also how globals are likely to be handled by
  asynchroneous futures.


Version: 0.4.2 [2015-06-15]
o plan() records the call.
o Added demo("mandelbrot", package="future"), which can be
  re-used by other future packages.


Version: 0.4.1 [2015-06-14]
o Added plan().
o Added eager future - useful for troubleshooting.


Version: 0.4.0 [2015-06-07]
o Distilled Future API from (in-house) 'async' package.
